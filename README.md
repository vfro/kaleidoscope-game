# Kaleidoscope

Simple puzzle game

## Rules

Colors of borders should be congruent. Pick hexagon from blue cells and put it into grid. Hexagons can be temporary stored in yellow cells and destroyed in red cell. Destroying hexagons cause your score to decrease. You can rotate hexagon by clicking right mouse button. Gray border can be adjoined with any other color. Good luck.
